This README file contains information about the programmable registers
in the CCEIP/CDDIP/KME.  This directory contains an ".html" file for
each block in the CCEIP/CDDIP with a description of the programmable
registers in each block.  For the KME, a single ".html" file is
provided. The addresses in these files are offsets from a base. The
remaining files in this directory are described below.


CCEIP_CDDIP_Memory_Maps.pdf - CCEIP/CDDIP memory maps with the base
address of each block

xp10_prefix.config_annotated - Sample config file that illustrates the
register accesses used for the xp10_prefix CCEIP test with
annotation. Config files for each test are located in
zipline/dv/CCE_64/tests and zipline/dv/CDD_64/tests.

For the KME there is only one .config file for all of the tests:
zipline/dv/KME/tests/kme.config
